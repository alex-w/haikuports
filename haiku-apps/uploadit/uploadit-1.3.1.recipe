SUMMARY="A Tracker add-on to upload a file or folder to an online service"
DESCRIPTION="UploadIt is a Tracker Add-On that uploads a single file or folder \
to an online service, currently https://temp.sh. A folder gets automatically \
zipped up before it's uploaded.

The URL for the uploaded file is put into the clipboard after the upload has \
finished, ready to be pasted into an email, a chat window or forum post.

Uploaded files are retained for 3 days. The maximum file size is 4 GiB.

Tip: Install Clipdinger from HaikuDepot. It includes a 'Clipboard Monitor' \
that you can embed as Replicant on the Desktop. When you see the upload URL \
appearing there, you know the file was uploaded successfully and the URL can \
be pasted."
